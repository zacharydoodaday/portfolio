								<h3>Tasks Performed</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><i>Preliminary data analysis (confusion matrices and precision score comparisons)</i> were used to identify which type of devices were prone to misclassifications. This insight made us aware about how shared characteristics within device classes could lead to misclassifications. For example, how two different brands of security cameras can share many similar IoT features such as bandwidth transmission, hence appearing similar to each other which can cause the different brands to be misclassified.</li>
									<li><i>Feature importance testing</i> was performed to identify both irrelevant and high importance features in the dataset.</li>
									<li><i>Sampling techniques</i>, particularly stratified sampling (both with and without replacement) and a sliding window, were coded to analyse the change in each models' accuracy over time and determine how often the models would need to be retrained when accuracy drops.</li>
									<li><i>Model design</i>. The following models were used:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Random Forest</li>
										<li>XGBoost with both Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularisation</li>
										<li>Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBM) with optimised learning rate, tree depth and number of trees</li>
										<li>LightGBM</li>
									</ul>
									<li><i>Model evaluation</i>. These models were evaluated and compared to eachother based on factors including; device classification accuracy, weighted average F1 score (to address in-class imbalance), training and run time, and recall (useful for cybersecurity because higher recall reduces the number of false negatives, minimising the risk of overlooking an insecure device that could expose the network to attacks, i.e. the cost of undetected vulnerabilities outweighs the occasional false positive).</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Reflection</h3>
								<p>
									Learning about how each of the models worked, the pros and cons of each, how to optimise them, how to test them, and how to code them. These are skills that I feel will be really useful to me as a Data Scientist. 
									The process that my team implemented to select and improve our models was very methodical, introducing me to how I would likely solve future classification problems. 
									I had an excellent team to work with on this project whom I learned a lot from. Prior to this project, I had no familiarity with many of these models which were introduced and taught to me by my team. For that I am very grateful.
