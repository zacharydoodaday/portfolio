							<h1>AI/ML Football Analysis</h1>
							<p>
								In this project I explored the applications of computer vision. My goal was to learn about some of the techniques used to generate data from video sources. 
								To achieve this, I utilised the <b>Ultralytics YOLO model and cv2 libraries.</b>. The tasks I performed during this project included:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li><u>Optimising object classifications</u>
									<p>
										After the initial run of object detection, minor adjustments were made, such as reclassifying goalkeepers as players to reduce the number of distinct object classes.
										I also designed bounding boxes for each class of object (players, referees, ball) to help track their locations.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li><u>Designing visual overlays that react to object movement</u>
									<p>
										Created circular indicators which would follow each object's bounding box and react to their movements. 
										A triangular indicator was designed to follow the ball.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li><u>Extracting colour data to enable team assignment</u>
									<p>
										This was achieved by capturing an image of each player's torso and performing k-means clustering on the image to separate the jersey colour from the background.
										Players were then assigned to a team based on their jersey colour, and their individual circular overlay colour was matched accordingly. 
									</p>
								</li>
								<li><u>Designing proximity data to calculate possession statistics</u>
									<p>
										I determined which player's feet were closest ball's bounding box to infer team possession. 
										Additionally, since the ball often travelled at speeds faster that what the video's low frame rate could capture, interpolation was used to predict the ball's movement and speed between frames. 
										The player in possession was also given a triangular indicator to help viewers identify them more easily.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li><u>Calculating individual player speed and distance while adjusting for camera movement and persepective</u>
									<p>
										I used the halfway line as a reference to track camera movement, which is represented at the top left of the video. 
										The tilt of the camera angle was also considered, as the video's perspective did not represent both sides of the field with equal proportions. 
										This was achieved by assigning greater distance weightings to objects travelling in the area of the field further from the camera.
										With these adjustments, more accurate speed and distance metrics were calculated and displayed under each player by comparing their positions across frames. 
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>
								Reflection
							</h3>
							<p>
								I learned the basics of computer vision and object detection in a context that I am personally very passionate about. 
								I also discovered some of the key considerations when using video as a data source such as accounting for the camera's perspective when calculating distance.
								Improvements can still be made, some of the players on the right-side of the video seem to not display their speed and distance metrics which is unintentional.
								Overall, I'm very proud of this project and believe that a future role as a video/performance analyst at a sports club would excite me.
